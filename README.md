# Project Greenhouse - Sprint 2

## Story
Project Greenhouse is a simple web application which is being designed and developed by Krisztina Turi. The general task was to come up with an application I would find useful. After a bit of thinking, I thought of a web app that combines certain types of plant related websites - the ones where you can buy plants online, the ones where you youself can sell houseplants and a webshop for useful products that will help you become the ultimate plant parent. And then, after I blended all of these webapps, the idea of Project Greenhouse was born.

## Technologies Used
Front end: React.JS

Back end: Java with Spring Boot

(In Development) Database: PostgreSQL

## Tasks
- basic file and folder structure - ~80% done
- skeleton code for back end - ~50% done
- fetching data with React - ~50% done
- common webpage elements (header, footer, navbar) - ~40% done
- webpage design - ~25% done

## Future Plans
- save data into a database
- rework fetching - right now the web page gets data from a foreign API, but the code to fetch from my own web server is ready to use
- render more pages - in its current stage, the webapp only have one functional page, everything else is just a placeholder
- log in and sign up system
- work more on the design - I went for a really simple one to save time, but I'd like to spice it up a little bit
